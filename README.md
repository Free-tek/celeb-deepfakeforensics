# DFF: A New Dataset for DeepFake Forensics

## Overview
We construct the __DeepFakeForensics (DFF)__ dataset 
with synthesized videos that have similar visual quality on par with those 
circulated online.
The DFF dataset includes xxx real and synthesized videos of human faces of different age, ethic group and gender.
